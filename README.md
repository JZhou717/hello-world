Tutorial Project - learning how to use Github

A small test to learn some tricks about git. Currently going over how to create branches off of the master project. These branches are self-contained copies of the master. These branches allow us to do edits to the project that we are working on without saving to the original and losing previous progress. We can later merge the branches to the master version to implement accepted and tested updates.
